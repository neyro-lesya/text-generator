In a future world, North America as we know it has been destroyed and the continent is now divided into 12 regions.
The capital of this new nation, Panem, is in the Rocky Mountains and the remaining districts (1-12) are spread in descending order throughout the continent. Katniss lives in District 12, the last district, in what we call as the Appalachian Mountains. The closer you are to the Capital, the better off your district is. District 12 is in charge of mining coal and as the last district they are exceedingly poor. Starvation is a way of life and ever since Katnissâ€™ father died in a mining accident, she has been in charge of caring for her mother and 12 year old sister, Prim.
